     * This function will be called as soon as the EnergyNet finishes voltage calculation
     * Suitable for TileEntities which implement any of the following:<br>
     * ISECableTile, ISEGridTile and ISEMachineTile<br>
     * Warning: this function is called from the EnergyNet thread, so do not directly interact with
     * Blocks, TileEntities or anything in the world.<br>
     * Inappropriate multi-threading can lead to random weirdness in the game and
     * it can extremely hard to locate the problem.<br>
     * <br>
     * The recommended solution is to schedule a task to the server's queue so that
     * the server thread will execute them.<br>

     * Since this method is server-only, the world object in TileEntities must be WorldServer,
     * (Remember EnergyNet threads are server threads, clients can not have them!),
     * so simply cast the world object into WorldServer and call WorldServer.addScheduledTask()
