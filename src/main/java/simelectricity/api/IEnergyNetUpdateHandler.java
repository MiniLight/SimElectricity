     * Warning: this function is called from the energynet thread, so do not directly update
     * Blocks\TileEntities or anything in the world. </p>
     * Inappropriate multi-threading can lead to random weirdness in the game and 
     * it can extremely hard to locate the problem. </p>

     * and the server thread will execute them. </p>

     * (Remember EnergyNet threads are server threads, clients can not have them!),
     * so simply cast the world object into WorldServer type and call WorldServer.addScheduledTask()
